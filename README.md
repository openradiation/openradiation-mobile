# Requirements

[Node 8.10.0 (or more recent LTS version)](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to build and test the application.

Then you need to download project dependencies by running `npm install` in the source directory.

# Usefull commands

1.  Start a local server to test the app => `npm run start` (most of app features won't be available thought since it requires real device hardware like bluetooth)
2.  Run the app on your phone connected by USB and with developer mode enabled => `npm run run:android`
