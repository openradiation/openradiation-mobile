Select the appropriate measurement mode according to if you take measurements at ground level or on board a plane. To ensure that the data received is homogeneous, comparable and as representative as possible, measurements taken at ground level and published on OpenRadiation must ideally be taken outdoors, if possible at a distance from housing, and with the sensor at a height of approximately 1 m above the ground. The longer the measurement, the more precise the measurement and hence the statistics: an indicator reflects the reliability of the measurement as you take it. After completing the measurement, you can qualify the local environment at ground level (in a rural area, in town) or on board a plane (flight number) and enter additional information before publishing the data. This information can be used to appraise the reliability of the measurement more precisely and to consolidate data.",
